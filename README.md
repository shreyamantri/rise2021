Project: Schizophrenia is a chronic neurological disorder that is characterized by hallucinations. However, indidviduals are diagnosed as Schizophrenic only after experiencing traumatic episodes. With that, this project applies Machine Learning (ML) to diagnose patients as Schizophrenic by detecting schizophrenia-induced hallucinations given a patient's EEG (electroencephalogram) data, or brain activity.
